              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                FitHealth is a comprehensive meal planning and grocery shopping app designed to help users plan and track their meals while providing access to a wide variety of recipes that cater to different dietary restrictions, preferences, and budgets. It serves as a convenient alternative to traditional in-person nutritionist consultations, empowering health-conscious individuals to control their dietary choices independently and sustainably.

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>
                Health-conscious individuals often struggle to maintain nutritious eating habits due to cost and inconvenience. Key problems identified include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pricing of Healthy Meals: Healthier and alternative choices are typically more expensive compared to unhealthy ones, creating a budget barrier for users.</li>
                <li>Inconvenient Traditional Methods: Reliance on in-person consultations with nutritionists and trainers is not convenient for users with busy schedules.</li>
                <li>Intrusive Advertising: Users frequently express frustration with excessive and irrelevant advertisements in existing apps, leading to dissatisfaction with the user experience.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                FitHealth was developed to provide cheaper, healthier options at a lower cost, streamlined planning, and a clean, ad-minimal user interface.

              <h4>Design Methodology Highlights</h4>
              <p>
                The UI design of FitHealth was guided by core Design Principles and Mobile Usability heuristics to ensure an intuitive and engaging experience:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Consistency & Navigation: The app maintains a consistent layout, utilizing a clear navigation bar to easily switch between meal planning, recipe library, and grocery shopping.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Affordance & Control: User interface controls (text boxes, radio buttons, menus) are clearly designed to communicate their purpose, giving users control over dietary restrictions, budget, and meal choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Concise Content: Content is simplified (Mobile Usability) to help users quickly learn ingredients and calorie counts, specifically tailored to their dietary needs and restrictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Recovery & Constraints: Features are incorporated to allow users to recover from errors (undo actions) and constraints are set to prevent incompatible dietary restrictions.
                </li>
              </ul>

                </div>
                <p>
                    This project was instrumental in applying core Usability Heuristics (like Consistency, Control, and Affordance) and addressing specific Mobile Usability needs (like Concise Content and Simple Navigation) within a health context. The primary challenge was balancing the complexity of nutritional data and personalized planning with the need for a simple, inviting, and user-friendly interface that encourages daily adoption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designing features like the AI-linked meal creation and GPS grocery integration highlighted the need for seamless back-end integration with front-end simplicity. The project confirmed that simplifying logistics (like price comparisons and shopping lists) is the most effective way to help users achieve long-term lifestyle changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next Steps: Future development should focus on enhancing the social community features to improve user engagement and retention, and continuous testing of the AI personalization tool to ensure the recipe recommendations are always culturally relevant and budget-appropriate.
