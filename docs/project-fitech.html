              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The Barako Fitness App (FITech) is a comprehensive mobile application designed to simplify gym membership management, class and event bookings, equipment rentals, and personalized workout planning. It serves as an all-in-one user-friendly platform, generating revenue through membership fees, bookings, and rentals, while significantly improving the gym's operational efficiency.

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>
                Barako Fitness Gym faced declining memberships due to outdated, manual processes and poor member retention strategies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lack of Integration: Business processes, especially membership renewal payments, were done manually, creating inconvenience for members.</li>
                <li>Poor Engagement: The gym lacked connection with members due to little to no loyalty benefits or structured promotions.</li>
                <li>Unequal Promotion: Diverse fitness ventures (CrossFit, Zumba) received unequal attention, unintentionally prioritizing some over others.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The gym needed a technological leap to enhance convenience, boost customer loyalty, and ensure equal promotion of all its offerings.

              <h4>Users</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Young Adults (15-25):</strong> Need affordable options and in-app benefits to support inconsistent routines.</li>
                <li><strong>Working Professionals (26-35):</strong> Need flexible, advance workout scheduling and planning to fit busy lifestyles.</li>
                <li><strong>Middle-aged Adults (36-45):</strong> Need guidance and personalized advice (coach consultation) due to mobility concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>Gym Owners:</strong> Need a personalized dashboard to easily monitor sales, check important data, and promote all classes equally.</li>

              <p>
                Insights gathered from target customers (gym-goers) and stakeholders that guided the app's structure and feature set:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inconvenient Payments: Members found the manual process for renewal payments "inconvenient and often overlooked," leading to missed dues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lack of Motivation: Customers reported "no incentive to stay committed" beyond the first month due to the absence of a loyalty program.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Scheduling Difficulty: Busy users needed a way to easily schedule and book classes in advance to prevent their lifestyle from hindering their workout routine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Owner Monitoring: Stakeholders confirmed they lacked a centralized, data-driven system to monitor sales and ensure equitable promotion across all gym ventures.
                </li>
              </ul>

                The app is designed to be built using React Native. This choice ensures cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android) from a single codebase, maximizing cost efficiency and enabling faster feature updates. Development would follow the Agile methodology to ensure flexibility, continuous user feedback integration, and the incremental release of features across various sprints.
              </p>
              <p>
                This approach ensures the app is scalable, responsive, and aligns with the mission of enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

                    As a conceptual project, the primary measure of FITech's success is defined by its ability to resolve the pain points identified during research, thereby driving specific, measurable business improvements for Barako Fitness Gym.

                    These targets are based on eliminating major friction points: the Online Payment System addresses manual processing, the Consecutive Renewal Benefits drive retention, and the integrated Activity Calendar boosts enrollment across all offerings.

                </div>
                <p>
                    The main challenge in designing FITech was creating a cohesive system that effectively served two masters: member convenience and owner efficiency. The solution required careful information architecture planning to balance user-facing features (tracking, scheduling) with the business needs (payment, data reporting).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project strengthened my understanding of product strategy—specifically, how UI/UX can directly translate into business metrics like member retention (via the rewards system) and operational cost reduction (via online payments). It highlighted the value of using technology to transform traditionally manual service industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next Steps: Should this concept move forward, the next phase would involve creating a high-fidelity interactive prototype and conducting targeted usability testing on the scheduling and payment flows to validate the design before full development. Key performance indicators (KPIs) to track would be membership renewal rate and class enrollment rates.
