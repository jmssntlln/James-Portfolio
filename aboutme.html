            <p>
              Growing up in Batangas, I developed a natural curiosity for how
              technology can make everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. I’ve
              always enjoyed figuring out how things work and finding small ways
              to improve the experiences people interact with. Over time, this
              interest led me to explore different areas of tech—from design and
              development to analytics and project work. Eventually, I found my
              strength in building clean, user-friendly digital products.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve worked on projects like an AI-powered complaint and feedback
              system for DPWH Batangas IV, where I handled frontend development
              and UI/UX design for both web and mobile. I enjoy working with
              tools like React, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and design
              platforms such as Figma and Canva. I value collaborating with
              teams, solving problems through thoughtful design, and creating
              solutions that are both functional and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way, I’ve earned recognition such as winning first place
              in the 2025 iPitch Competition and completing training in
              SmartBooks ERP and Power BI. At my core, I’m someone who values
              clarity, good design, and continuous learning—and I’m always
              excited to build, explore, and create things that help people in
              practical and meaningful ways.
